earn (rewards)

Problem: 


Play to earn & Build payment trust in the game
Main game paltform: spend tokenI(nonce) on your very own character
subgames: provides tokenI through sub-games
similar to the model of OASIS in READY PLAYER ONE 

BUT the token is based on BLOCKCHAIN(Lightning Network)
so its anonynous, secure even can trade Cross Blockchains
GAME IS OPEN FOR EVERYONE AND THAT MATCH THE IDEA OF DECENTRALIZATION


problem -- transformation of data, gamer's operation achievement:
command(backend running code) we can get from most games are same
→ solution: candy crush, go game, card game. 
Mining: random command lines→ change into int to guess if correct key/address 
Advantage: 
Users:
money 
Vendor
population size → money ; convenience to data mining 
Krypto currency
