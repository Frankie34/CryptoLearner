# testVersion

Problem: 

Play to earn & Build payment trust in the game
Main game paltform: spend tokenI(nonce) on your very own character
subgames: provides tokenI through sub-games
similar to the model of OASIS in READY PLAYER ONE 

BUT the token is based on BLOCKCHAIN(Lightning Network)
so its anonynous, secure even can trade Cross Blockchains
GAME IS OPEN FOR EVERYONE 
AND THAT MATCH THE IDEA OF DECENTRALIZATION(everyone follow the smart contract)


ProblemSet: 
  1. command(backend running code) we can get from most games are very likely the same code
solution: collect data from candy crush, go game, card game. 
  2. transformation of data (gamer's operations)
_MiningAlgorithm: random feedback â†’ SHA into key/address and take the chance to get tokenI


# Account Parametres

UserID(address):
Balance(TokenI): (the more game your play the more tokenI you would be likely to get)
